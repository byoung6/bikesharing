## 1. Overview of the Project

The purpose of the project is to create three distinct deliverables: 1. updating the existing CSV file to change one of of the cell's data type, in order to fully utilize Tableau; 2. Creating visualizations for the trip analysis with Tableau; and 3. creating a story and report for the final presentation of data.

## 2. Analysis/Results

The analysis overviews checkout times for Users. The first graph shows the total checkouts in relation to the duration of trip

The second graph shows the total checkouts in relation to duration of trip across female, male, and unknown genders.

The third graph shows a heatmap of overall trips per hour of each weekday. We can see higher trip concentration during typical rush hour, starting at 6AM, ending at 10AM, and beginning again at 4PM, ending at 9PM.

The fourth chart shows a heatmap of overall trips per hour of each weekday, split among Female, Male, and uknown genders. The relation is typically the same as the third chart.

The fifth chart shows the difference between usertype, split between subscribers of the product, and one time customers. Obviously, the subscriber user base would be higher than the Customer userbase across all fields.

## 3. Summary
As we can see through the visualization, there is increased use of the Citibike during rush hour, as both individuals identifying as male, and female have used the Citibike as an alternative form of travel. Additionally, we see higher use from subscribers. Additional consideration should be given to gender start and end locations to better assist with marketing subscription services across genders. We see from the below visualizations that there is wide gender difference between start and stop locations of users of Citibike. 

Start locations by gender.
